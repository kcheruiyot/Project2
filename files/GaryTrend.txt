Trend is there any coorelation to the distribution of the vaccine to the number of confirmed cases and deaths.

The wide spread distribution ofthe vaccine began in December of 2020.

After looking at the complete dataset for each individual state. I decided to concentrate on the time period of Noveber 1, 2020 until March 1, 2021.

From this I could see that most of the covid confirmed cases were from this time period.

I examined the percent of total confirmed cases and percent of total deaths.

From this I was able to determine that for all the states the confirmed case fell between 40% and 70% for this period of four months.

To whom it may concern:
The data definetly shows that the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US States occured around the time that the vaccines were made available to the citizens of the USA.
